Company created by engineersfor engineers
We have created a company where experienced engineers implement projects that they have knowingly chosen. We bring the partners closer to their business goals and we continually improve the expertise of j‑specialists. We invest in people, because they are at the heart of j‑labs.


Reliability, merit approach and technology
We create an environment where work gives us satisfaction and personal growth. The organisational culture relies on values and collaboration is initiated with people who share our beliefs. Thanks to this, we face challenges together.

Who we are?
We are reliable. We devote ourselves to what we do and we maintain high quality.

We go with merit approach. We build a team of experts in specific fields, who continue to develop.

We focus on technology. In the Java “laboratory” (hence the name j‑labs!), equipment and results go hand in hand with technology development.

Knowledge worth sharing. J-labs brings together a committed community of people who are united by their passion for technology. Talk4Devs is a festival of knowledge from engineers for engineers.
We have been meeting since 2014.
